HOW TO RUN APPLICATION
First, ensure that you have Docker Desktop installed.
If necessary, pull any db to Docker, but it shouldn't be necessary.
Run Docker before doing anything, it is essential that Docker is composed.
Run the docker command docker-compose up -d, other commands should not work as well.
Now, download the backend from the following link (https://github.com/joaogaabriel/House-Of-Tasks)
With docker running, open the backend folder and run nmp run start
Wait for gulp to compile and run the backend successfully.
Now, download the frontend from the following link (https://github.com/joaogaabriel/House-Of-Tasks---Frontend)
